<p>I have a deep interest in techonology driven innovation and entrepreneurship.  While my education and work experience have always leaned towards economics and finance, I have always maintained a keen interest in technology.  Two years ago, I left the world of consulting behind in order to perform a self-education experiment on myself.  I wanted to explore the nascent but exploding number of online learning resources to see how companies where using online learning resources and to think how they could be improved with the ultimate goal of transitioning my career into the space.  I believe that I have a deep understanding of the space from the users perspective and now find myself looking to move into the space on the development side.  The Management, IS, and Digital Innovation master’s program at the LSE would be the perfect stepping stone to allow me to reach my goal.</p>

<p>With regards to my educational background, I went to high school at Hardvard-Westlake, a top prep school in the nation, and then received my bachelor’s degree from Emory University, a top 25 university.  One of my specific interests in your program is that while I have a prestigious educational background that background is entirely based in the US.  A degree from the LSE would open up more opportunities outside of the US as potential business partners or employers would recognize not only the LSE brand, but my ability to succeed in an international environment.  Then beyond the prestige of the school, I really like that the program focuses on management and how it relates to technology and innovations.  Rather than pursue an MBA, which casts a wider net, I want to concentrate on an area of study that most interests me.  The fact that this is a one year program rather than a two year program will allow me to quickly jump back into the real world. </p>

<p>Some of my strengths academically and professionally include my problem solving ability and my ability to think outside the box.  Before leaving the consulting world, I decided to explore pursuing a traditional MBA, so I took the GMAT.  My score of 760 on my first attempt placed me in the 99th percentile and demonstrates my exceptional problem solving ability.  On the outside the box thinking front, I believe my life since leaving consulting demonstrates this very well.  While I cannot go into all the details, I do want to discuss my English teaching program at the Rütli Schule.  Through connections that I developed while in Berlin, I was given free reign to create my own course to teach English to students in the 11th, 12th, and 13th grades at an underprivileged school in Berlin.  The challenges were two fold.  First, I had to teach English to students with an incredibly wide range of experience, skill, and confidence.  Secondly, I had to keep the students engaged in what was a voluntary class for them.  My solution was to use online language learning tools to not only improve their study habits, but also to foster discussions in English.  Using sites such as Quizlet.com, I was able to accommodate students of any level and tailor individual help to any student that needed it.  I love tackling these sorts of open-ended problems.</p>

<p>While I have significant experience as a consultant working with large companies, a stronger educational foundation of technology and management would suit me well.  Specifically, I want to study management of IS infrastructure and online businesses.  My current role at Cygnus Association Management is my only professional experience with managing IS infrastructure.  While I have learned invaluable lessons from this experience, there is room for improvement in my processes.  Since I would continue my role at Cygnus, I could implement ideas from courses such as Management and Economics of E-Business and Innovation and Information Systems: Concepts and Perspectives directly into practice as I learn them. </p>
