## David Pollack's Resumes

I wanted my resume to be available on a variery of formats, the least important of which was paper.  Thus I decided to use [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) with the [Whitespace theme](https://github.com/lucaslew/whitespace) and some minor modifications.  Feel free to use this as a template for your own resume.
