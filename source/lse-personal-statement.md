### Instructions:

You must submit a personal statement that outlines your academic interest in and understanding of your chosen programme(s), as well as your purpose and objectives in undertaking graduate study. Your personal statement should be typed and be no longer than about two sides of A4 paper. There is no fixed word limit but we expect this to be approximately 1,000 - 1,500 words. Some programmes have specific requirements which are different to this. Please check the relevant programme page for information.

Please ensure that your personal statement is well written, clearly describing your academic background, strengths and interests, and your ambitions/research interests. You should include any relevant additional information, such as additional reading or research, work or other relevant experiences that have informed your decision to apply for study at LSE. You may also wish to highlight areas of specific interest within the programme(s) applied for.

If you are applying for two programmes please ensure that your personal statement addresses why you are applying for each programme. In the case where your two programme choices are unrelated, you may submit two personal statements - they should be clearly headed within a single document.

Please make sure that each page of your personal statement bears your name as a header or footer.
