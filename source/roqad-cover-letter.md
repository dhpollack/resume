I am writing to you to formally express my interest in the position of Business Development Intern at Roq.ad that you posted to the MEMS email list and that we spoke about last week.

My initial attraction to the company stemmed from the impression that Roq.ad is a cutting-edge data-driven firm with a tangible advantage in the field of cross-device identification over competitors such as those from Silicon Valley.  All of which was confirmed by my initial talk with Jet.  The online advertising world is the next frontier in data science and I am fascinated at the prospect of making data-driven decision to shape a growing start up such as yours.  Currently I am working towards a Masters in Economics and Management Science (MEMS) at Humboldt Universit√§t with a focus on statistics.  My interests, and primary reason for returning to school, lie in machine learning and the entrepreneurial world of startups.  I am taking classes such as Statistical Programming Languages, Multivariate Statistics, and Machine Intelligence (at TU).

At university, I've also taken advantage of the Sprachzentrum to improve my German.  I'm a true believer in the Internet, and when I moved to Germany 3 years ago, I wanted to see if I could learn a language from scratch using only free online tools.  Thus I learned German without enrolling in formal language classes until last October when I started at HU.  I am quite comfortable with German and generally test at a B2/C1 level with certain aspects (vocabulary) being better than others (grammar).  And as for my mother tongue, English, I can provide you with more than simply my place of birth but also with a score in the 99th percentile on the verbal section of the GMAT, an extremely competitive entrance exam for MBA programs (and 99th percentile overall).

Before moving to Germany, I worked as a consultant at Navigant Consulting in construction management, insurance, and banking for 7.5 years.  There I worked on many projects with clients ranging from local contractors to behemoths of industry such as Bank of America.  While on my final project at Navigant working with Bank of America, due to bureaucratic realities we would often get very little feedback on our work product, but through various signals, I would intuit that the bank wanted us to make changes to something we were doing.  In these cases, I took the initiative to autonomously adapt my work accordingly and in several instances these changes were cited by the client and became the best practices for our project's entire team of 50+ people.  Recently I started a small real estate management firm with 2 friends from my bachelors, where I am primarily responsible for the technology systems that we utilize, but as one could imagine in a company of 3 people everyone has to do a little bit of everything.  Relating to your open position, the ability to make decisions that affect all aspects of a business is one very intriguing aspect of the responsibilities of the job.

Given my wealth of working experience, applicable educational background, and experience in entrepreneurial ventures, I believe I am uniquely qualified to help drive Roq.ad's business objectives and would be delighted to discuss the Business Development Intern position further in an interview.  I am finished with most of my obligations for the semester as of July 22nd and could begin as soon as possible.

Thank you for your time and if you have any questions for me, please do not hesitate to ask.

With kind regards,  
David Pollack
