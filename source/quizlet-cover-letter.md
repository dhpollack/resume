Brevity is the soul of wit so without much ado...

My story begins with the typical path along the yellow brick road to success.  [Supportive parents](http://imgur.com/iNoTIJj), [top 25 college](http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/emory-university-1564), well-paying job in [financial services consulting](http://www.navigant.com/industries/financial-services/), etc, etc.  Over time, I developed a desire to use my talents to have a greater positive impact on the world (yes, I know bankers have feelings too but...).  So I left the cushy world of consulting to pursue my own experiments in online education.  My two main targets were MOOCs and language learning.

So with the miles I earned flying back and forth from DC as a consultant, I decided to move to Berlin, because "Hey, why not?  The internet is there too."  I could write a novel on the experience, but in a word "ausgezeichnet" (excellent)!

I know what you're thinking.  Two paragraphs and no logical connection to Quizlet. Ok, ok, here we go...

I was lucky enough to stumble into an opportunity to create my own after-school program at an [underprivileged high school in Berlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%BCtli_School) (think [Danger Minds auf deutsch](http://www.spiegel.de/international/letter-from-berlin-germany-s-school-of-hard-knocks-a-409876.html) sans [Coolio](http://financialjuneteenth.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/A-booking-agency-lists-the-price-of-booking-celebrity-performers-for-parties-Coolio-charges-20-thousand-dollars.-www.financialjuneteenth.com_.jpg) led soundtrack).  My course shows the students how they can supplement their studies with online language learning resources.  Their favorite resource is far and away Quizlet.

I recently read Quizlet is looking to expand and particularly internationally.  I would love to be part of that movement.  In addition to my business/consulting background required for the Business Operations role, I know your product and have seen how an international audience utilizes it.

I've attached my resume in PDF form to this email.  But I assume you guys aren't huge fans of paper even the digital kind.   Since you'll probably be looking at my resume on a screen, you can also visit [http://resume.da3.net/quizlet-resume](http://resume.da3.net/quizlet-resume).  The same thing is there in the form of a fully-responsive website created with a myriad of internet technologies.

Alright, this is already getting too long.  I hope to hear from you soon.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Herr David Pollack
