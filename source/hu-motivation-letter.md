### Motivation Letter - [{{ jobinfo.jobtitle }}]({{ jobinfo.jobpostingurl }})
{: #cover-letter-header }

Dear {{ jobinfo.coverletter.greetings }},

I am writing you to express my interest in joining the Master's of Economics and Management Science (MEMS) program at Humboldt Universität.  The program's fusion of economics and management interests me, because I believe in the importance of a practical management education supported by a strong quantitative foundation.  Additionally, I believe that the international environment at Humboldt will set me up for success in the global economy.

I originally come from Los Angeles, California and received my BA from Emory University in 2005.  After working for a top consulting firm for 7 years, I decided to move to Berlin in order to pursue other opportunities.  Specifically, I was interested in transitioning to the world of technology.  In the two shorts years that I have spent in Berlin, I have started my endeavours that I couldn't have anticipated before I came here.  For one, I founded a company that manages housing communities in Atlanta, GA.  I work remotely researching, operating, and maintaining all of the technological solutions that we employ.  I also created my own after-school program for students at the Rütli Schule where I guide them through various online tools one can use to improve his or her English.  I have practical experience in management, but I would like to fortify this experience with more theory.  Looking at your course options, I am particularly interested in the courses: Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Advanced Information Systems, and Game Theory.  These classes would directly apply to my current roles as well as any future endeavours that I pursue.  

Another reason that I would like to pursue a masters at Humboldt is that I would have the opportunity to improve my German with your language courses.  When I choose to move to Berlin, I wanted to challenge myself to learn a completely new language without the aid of traditional, expensive language courses.  Instead I was determined to find and use free online resources such as Duolingo.com and Memrise.com and practical experience (i.e. using the language in the real world) to learn the language.  While I am proud to say that my German went from absolutely nothing to almost passing the TestDAF (I got three 3s and one unter 3), I know that I would benefit from formal courses in German.  Furthermore, I am also interested in learning a third language.  Even though I have only lived in Europe for two years, I find the potpourri of languages quite fascinating and see online language learning as a potential career path.  I would almost certainly use the study abroad period to put this third language to use.  While English has become the world's lingua franca, one cannot discount the value of communicating with others in their native tongue.  

Humboldt also piques my interest because of the location here in Berlin.  Having lived here for two years, I know how dynamic the city can be.  I have developed great relationships doing volunteer work at the Prinzessinnengarten and the Rütli Schule, which are two things that I look forward to continuing while pursuing my degree.  The ability to leverage my current social network here in Berlin to pursue potential entrepreneurial endeavours is a unique feature of Humboldt that places the MEMS program at the top of my list of programs.  With a degree from a prestigious university like Humboldt, I could solidify my connections in Europe and Berlin in particular and leverage these connections in my future career pursuits.  

Finally, I also believe that I have a lot to offer to the university and my fellow students.  I can share my experiences as a consultant in the US with my classmates and tap into that network professionally for classmates who would like to pursue that line of work.  Personally, I have the unique perspective of living in Berlin als ein Auslander and can share my experiences with my classmates from where to go out to eat to how to deal with the Ausländerbehörde.  Since 80% of the incoming class will not be German, I am sure they will appreciate these insights.  I really enjoy getting to know different types of people, thus the diversity of the MEMS intake appeals to me. 

In conclusion, I feel that my goals and strength fit well with the mission of the MEMS program and that I could enrich the Humboldt community with a unique perspective.  Thanks for your time and I look forward to the opportunity to become part of the MEMS program.

Sincerely,
David

PS.  My letters of recommendation come from my current colleagues.  Since I have been out of university for over a decade, these people will provide you with the best perspective of my character, work ethic, and academic capabilities.
