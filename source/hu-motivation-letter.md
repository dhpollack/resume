### Motivation Letter - [jobinfo.jobtitle]({{ jobinfo.jobpostingurl }})
{: #cover-letter-header }

Dear {{ jobinfo.coverletter.greetings }},

I am writing you to express my interest in joining the MEMS program at Humboldt Universität.  The program's fusion of economics and management interests me, because I believe in the importance of a practical management education backed by a strong quantitative basis.  Additionally, I believe that having experience understanding how to work with people from different cultures will be crucial to success in a global economy.

I originally come from Los Angeles, California and received my BA from Emory University in 2005.  After working for a top consulting firm for 7 years, I decided to move to Berlin two years ago in order to pursue other opportunities.  Specifically, I was interested in transitioning to the world of education technology.  I have a lot of practical experience in management, but I would like to fortify my experience with more theory.  Looking at your course options, I am particularly interested in Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Advanced Information Systems, and Game Theory.  These types of courses would directly apply to my future career regardless of whether I decide to continue as an entrepreneur or to join a larger firm as I had in the past.  

Another reason that I would like to pursue a masters at Humboldt is that I would have the opportunity to improve my German with your language courses.  When I choose to move to Berlin two years ago, I wanted to see how much of a completely new language I could learn without the aid of language courses and mostly using all of the free online resources available such as Duolingo.com and Memrise.com.  While I am proud to say that my German went from absolutely nothing to almost passing the TestDAF (I got three 3s and one unter 3), I know that I would benefit from formal courses in German.  If possible, I am also interested in learning a third language.  Even though I have only lived in Europe for two years, I find the potpourri of languages quite fascinating.  I would almost certainly use the study abroad period to put this third language to use.  While English has become the world's lingua franca, one cannot discount the value of communicating with others in their native tongue.  

Humboldt also piques my interest because of the location here in Berlin.  Having lived here for two years, I know how dynamic the city can be.  I have developed great relationships doing volunteer work at the Prinzessinnengarten and the Rütli Schule, which are two things that I would like to continue while pursuing my degree.  The ability to leverage my current social network here in Berlin to pursue potential entrepreneurial endeavours is a unique aspect of Humboldt that places it at the top of my list of places to study.  With a degree from a prestigious university such as Humboldt, I could solidify my connection to Europe and Berlin in particular.  

Finally, I also believe that I have a lot to offer to the university and my fellow students.  I can share my experiences as a consultant in the US with my classmates and even utilize that network professionally if someone wants to pursue that line of work.  Personally, I have the unique perspective of living in Berlin als ein Auslander and can share my experiences from places to go out to eat to how to deal with the Ausländerbehörde with my classmates.  Since 80% of the incoming class will not be German, I am sure they will appreciate a perspective of Berlin from the eyes of an outsider.

Thanks for your time and I look forward to the opportunity to become part of the Humboldt community.

Sincerely,
David

PS.  My letters of recommendation come from my current colleagues.  Since I have been out of university for over a decade, these people can best recommend me for the program.
