### Cover Letter - [{{jobinfo.jobtitle}}]({{ jobinfo.jobpostingurl }})
{: #cover-letter-header }

I am writing you to inquire about the possibility of a summer internship or work-student position as a Computer Vision Engineer.  

My name is David Pollack and I am pursuing a Master of Science in Economics with a specialization in Quantitative Methods at Humboldt Universität in Berlin.  I returned to school from the world of consulting because I believe the future belongs to machine learning (or creativity but I’m a crap misunderstood artist).  Courses I have taken include: Multivariate Statistics, Business Analytics and Data Science, Machine Intelligence I (supervised and reinforcement learning) + II (unsupervised learning).  The idea for my master’s thesis in language identification of audio, which has a lot of overlap with image classification (so far my best classifier is a model based off of ResNet built with PyTorch).  

I discovered EyeEm after I attended the AWS summit here in Berlin.  I came away really impressed by Rino Montiel’s talk on how EyeEm uses machine learning.  Particularly, the automatic tag suggestions combined several methods in clever ways to produce an intuitive, time-saving feature for your product.  The sheer amount of data EyeEm processes impressed me as did how you’ve found solutions to compete with the Googles of the world with a fraction of the resources.  Scarcity drives innovation and I want to be part of a smaller more agile firm.  

As someone who has been in the working world, I know there is no better teacher than experience.  I would love to work along side and learn from the engineers at EyeEm, and would be delighted to discuss the possibility of an internship or work-student position further in an interview.  Thank you for your time.
