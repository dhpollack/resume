### Cover Letter - [edX Relationship Manager for Europe]({{ jobinfo.jobpostingurl }})

Dear {{ jobinfo.coverletter.greetings }}:

I am writing this in regards to the [{{ jobinfo.jobtitle }}]({{jobinfo.jobpostingurl}}) position posted on the edX site.

My unique set of skills and experience fit the demands of this position perfectly.  Previously, I worked at a [top consulting firm](http://www.navigant.com) on projects in the banking, insurance, and construction industries.  In 2013, I decided that an MBA degree would be the best way to further my career as a consulting.  So I took the GMAT and [scored in the 99th percentile]({{ jobinfo.resumeurl.url | append: '#gmat'}}).  I was perfectly positioned to pursue an MBA in an amazing program and continue down the path as a consultant in the financial industry.

Then a funny thing happened.  During the application process, I took notice of the skyrocketing cost of education in the US and of MBA programs in particular.  Having just worked on cleaning up the mess created by the US housing crisis, the trend in education seemed strikingly similar.  However I knew that with these situations lies opportunity.  The internet has revolutionized many industries, and explosive growth in the education technology market seemed inevitable in the face of exploding costs.

However, my experience was in finance and not education.  How could I change the narrative of my career path to break into the edtech world?

I tend to look at problems from a unique perspective, and importantly, I wanted a complete perspective on the landscape of the industry.  So I decided to put my savings earmarked for the MBA towards my own experiment in online learning.  One part of the experiment involved learning about how universities were utilizing MOOCs on various platforms, including edX, and the other part was attempting to learning a new language using the latest online language learning tools.  In May 2013, I moved to Berlin, Germany without a job, without ever having been there before, without knowing a single person here, and without speaking a single word of German.

Almost two years later, despite what the naysayers told me, I can confidently say that was a fantastic decision.

I believe the ability to quickly acclimate myself into any environment underlies everything else one must do as a Relationship Manager.  Whether collaborating with my coworkers in a remote office as a consultant, inspiring under-privileged students in a foreign country, or starting a business with classmates from my university, I have always had a knack for managing relationships.  The job responsibilities of this position are a natual fit for an area that I have always excelled in.

But managing relationships is not everything.  A familiarity with educational technology and more specifically MOOCs is the core of this position.  I have started over 50 MOOCs on various platforms from various countries and received certificates of accomplishment in over a dozen (including from European universities) in subject areas spanning economics to computer science to art.  Having used many platforms, the ethos of edX as an open platform particularly attracts me.  I have even contributed to the [Open edX projects on Github]( {{ jobinfo.resumeurl.url | append: '#github' }} ).  I am passionate about edtech and love sharing my passion with others.  At the Rütli Schule, I organize an optional course for the students where I navigate them through the myriad of language learning tools that they can use to improve their English.  This opportunity only came about from relationships that I have built while I have been in Berlin and due to my vast knowledge of online learning opportunities.

Thank you for your time in considering me for the position of {{ jobinfo.jobtitle }}.  I relish the opportunity to put my stamp on the future of online education and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Herr. David Pollack

P.S. As a true believer in technology, I created a website for this application, so you could evaluate my candidacy for this position in any way you prefer whether that be with a piece of paper on your desk or from your mobile phone in the airport.
