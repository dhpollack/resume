### Cover Letter - [edX Relationship Manager for Europe]({{ jobinfo.jobpostingurl }})
{: #edx-cover-letter-header }

Dear {{ jobinfo.coverletter.greetings }}:

I am writing this in regards to the [{{ jobinfo.jobtitle }}]({{jobinfo.jobpostingurl}}) position posted on the edX site.

My unique set of skills and experience fit the demands of this position perfectly.  I have a strong educational background.  I attended one of the best high schools in the US and then received my bachelors from a top 25 university.  I then spent 7 years at a [top consulting firm](http://www.navigant.com) working on projects in the banking, insurance, and construction industries.  Two years ago, I decided to pivot my career away from the finance world and towards education instead.

Instead of immediately jumping from my consulting job in finance to something in edtech, I decided to conduct my own experiments in online education, especially MOOCs and language learning.  In May 2013, I moved to Berlin, Germany without a job, without knowing a single person in the city, and without speaking a single word of German.  Some of the results?  I have started over 50 MOOCs are many different platforms and received over a dozen certificates from ones that I completed in subjects ranging from computer science to marketing to art und jetzt kann ich auch deutsch.  :-)

As a Relationship Manager, I believe my ability to quickly acclimate myself to any environment would be invaluable.  Whether collaborating with my coworkers in a remote office as a consultant, inspiring under-privileged students in a foreign country to learn English, or starting a business with classmates from my university, I have always had a knack for managing relationships.  The position requires skills that I naturally excel in.

But managing relationships is not everything.  The position revolves around MOOCs.  Not only have I used many MOOC platforms, I have even contributed to the [Open edX projects on Github]( {{ jobinfo.resumeurl.url | append: '#github' }} ).  The commitment to openness driving edX also attracts me to the company.  I am passionate about edtech and love sharing my passion with others.  At the Rütli Schule, I organize an optional course for the students where I navigate them through the myriad of language learning tools that they can use to improve their English.  This opportunity only came about from relationships that I have built while I have been in Berlin and my persistence in an endless search to find resources to improve my German.

Thank you for your time in considering me for the position of {{ jobinfo.jobtitle }}.  I would relish the opportunity to put my stamp on the future of edtech and look forward to arranging a time to have an in-depth conversation about the position.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Herr. David Pollack
