### Cover Letter - [edX Relationship Manager for Europe]({{ jobinfo.jobpostingurl }})
{: #edx-cover-letter-header }

Dear {{ jobinfo.coverletter.greetings }}:

I am writing this in regards to the [{{ jobinfo.jobtitle }}]({{jobinfo.jobpostingurl}}) position posted on the edX site.

I believe my unique set of skills and experience fit the demands of this position perfectly.  I have a strong educational background.  I attended [Harvard-Westlake](http://www.hw.com), one of the best high schools in the US, and then received my bachelors from [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu), a top 25 university.  I then spent 7 years at [Navigant Consulting](http://www.navigant.com), a top consulting firm working on projects in the banking, insurance, and construction industries.  Two years ago, I decided to pivot my career away from the finance world and towards education technology.

Since edtech is such a new and constantly changing industry, I set out to conduct my own experiments in online education, particularly with MOOCs and language learning, in order to build my own opinions about the space.  In May 2013, I choose Berlin, Germany as the location for this experiment because of the growing tech community and the non-English speaking population.

In less than two years, I have started over 50 MOOCs on many different platforms and received over a dozen certificates in subjects ranging from computer science to marketing to art.  Not only have I used many MOOC platforms, I have even contributed to the [Open edX projects on Github]( {{ jobinfo.resumeurl.url | append: '#github' }} ).  I am passionate about edtech and love sharing my passion with others.  At the Rütli Schule, I organize an optional course for the students where I navigate students through the myriad of language learning tools that they can use to improve their English.  This opportunity only came about because I forged new relationships in Berlin over the past two years.  Additionally, I have taught myself German to a conversational level beginning from absolutely nothing using online language learning tools.

As a Relationship Manager, I believe my ability to quickly acclimate myself to any environment would be invaluable.  Whether collaborating with my coworkers in a remote office as a consultant, inspiring under-privileged students in a foreign country to learn English, or starting a business with classmates from my university, I have always had a knack for managing relationships.

Thank you for your time in considering me for the position of {{ jobinfo.jobtitle }}.  I look forward to arranging a time to have an in-depth conversation about the position.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  
Herr. David Pollack
