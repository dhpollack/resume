I am writing you to inquire about the Machine Learning Internship at Rasa.  

My name is David Pollack and I am pursuing a Master of Science in Economics with a specialization in Quantitative Methods at Humboldt Universität.  I returned to school from the world of consulting because I believe the future belongs to machine learning.  Courses I have taken include: Multivariate Statistics, Business Analytics and Data Science, Machine Intelligence I (supervised and reinforcement learning) + II (unsupervised learning).  The idea for my master’s thesis in language identification of audio and plan to implement a RNN with PyTorch, which overlaps with the Dialog Management used by Rasa.  

I discovered via Github when I came across Thomas Werkmeister’s [iLID repo](https://github.com/twerkmeister/iLID).  I also saw Alan at the Chatbot Summit and Tom at PyData.  I found Tom’s talk particularly impressive.  Not only what he demoed but also how he seemed very knowledgeable in ML and talked candidly about what worked and what didn’t work for him.  I noticed he used Tensorflow and Keras, but I was curious if you had considered a library that creates dynamic computation graphs natively?  Regardless, I find NLP intellectually fascinating although I admittedly don’t have any experience in the field, but I do believe I could contribute right away.  In fact, I was playing around with rasa\_nlu and submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_nlu/pull/443) on github to fix an installation bug.  

Ultimately there is no better teacher than experience.  I would love to get in at the ground floor at Rasa, and would be delighted to discuss what you guys are looking for either in a formal interview or informally over a cup of coffee.  Thanks for your time.
