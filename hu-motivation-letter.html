<p>Dear HU Entrance Committee,</p>

<p>I am writing you to express my interest in joining the Master’s of Economics and Management Science (MEMS) program at Humboldt Universität.  The program’s fusion of economics and management interests me, because I believe in the importance of a practical management education supported by a strong quantitative foundation.  Additionally, I believe that the international environment at Humboldt will set me up for success in the global economy.</p>

<p>I was born in Los Angeles, California and received my BA from Emory University in 2005.  After working for a top consulting firm for 7 years, I decided to move to Berlin in order to pursue other opportunities.  Specifically, I was interested in transitioning to the world of technology.  In the two shorts years that I have spent in Berlin, I have participated in so many endeavours that I would have never anticipated.  For one, I founded a company that manages housing communities in Atlanta, GA, where I went to university.  I work remotely researching, operating, and maintaining our technological solutions.  I also created my own after-school program for students at the Rütli Schule where I guide them through various online language learning tools to improve their English.  I have practical experience in management, but I would like to sublement this experience with more theory.  Looking at your course options, I believe classes such as Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Advanced Information Systems, and Game Theory would directly apply to my current roles as well as any future endeavours.  </p>

<p>The MEMS program would also give me the opportunity to improve my German via Sprachenzentrum der HU Berlin.  A main reason that I choose to move to Berlin was that I wanted to challenge myself to learn a completely new language without the aid of traditional language courses.  Instead I was determined to use free online resources such as Duolingo.com and real-world practice.  While I can proudly say my German went from absolutely nothing to nearly passing the TestDAF in less than two years.  Still, I know that I would benefit from formal courses.  Furthermore, I am also interested in learning a third language.  Even though I have only lived in Europe for two years, I find the potpourri of languages quite fascinating.  I would certainly use the program’s study abroad period to put this third language to use.  Firsthand experience has taught me that one cannot discount the value of communicating with others in their native tongue.  </p>

<p>Humboldt’s location here in Berlin also piques my interest.  I have developed great relationships doing volunteer work at the Prinzessinnengarten and the Rütli Schule, which are two things that I look forward to continuing.  The ability to leverage my current social network here in Berlin to pursue potential entrepreneurial endeavours is a unique feature of Humboldt.  A degree from a prestigious university like Humboldt solidifies my connection to the european market and Berlin in particular.  </p>

<p>Finally, I also believe that I have a lot to offer to the university and my fellow students.  I can share my experiences as a consultant in the US with my classmates and tap into that network professionally for classmates.  Personally, I have the unique perspective of living in Berlin as a foreigner and can share my experiences with my classmates from where to go out to eat to how to deal with the Ausländerbehörde.  Since 80% of the incoming class will not be German, I am sure they will appreciate these insights.  In general working with a diverse group of classmates will directly translate to working with a diverse group in the real world. </p>

<p>In conclusion, I feel that my goals and strength fit well with the mission of the MEMS program and that I could enrich the Humboldt community with a unique perspective.  Thanks for your time and I look forward to the opportunity to become part of the MEMS program.</p>

<p>Sincerely,
David</p>
